## Data Model

The GUI creates and manipulates a `Song` struct from the sequencer crate, which includes:
- Song metadata (name, BPM, speed)
- Arrangement grid (rows Ã— tracks matrix of chain indices)
- Banks for phrases, chains, instruments, and samples

## M8 Inspiration

The interface takes inspiration from the Dirtywave M8 tracker with:
- Clean, monospace font for data display
- Hexadecimal numbering system
- Grid-based arrangement view
- Minimal, functional design
